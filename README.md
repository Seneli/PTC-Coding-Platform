# PTC Coding Platform

This is the website me and a friend made as a submission platform for the PTC Coding Challenge in 2021. To view the live website, please navigate to https://coding-challenge.projecttechconferences.com/.

This website has the ability to create and log into a user account, reset the password for said account and submit files each week for a specific question. Users can also view their most recent submission through a "view submission" button. The website also has a personal leaderboard page that logged in users can navigate to, to see their scores for each submission. 

This website also has a secret user account that can be used to view all submissions for marking purposes. 

Note: 
- the .env file for the server folder and the admin account login information has been deleted from this repository for security reasons.
